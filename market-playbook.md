What’s Working Right Now:
Today’s GTM is about combining inherent virality in your product with a truly authentic go to market strategy centered around community building. There are several tactics we see working, and two general ground rules.  There’s one rule for product, and one rule for go-to-market strategy:

Product Ground Rule: Be a multiplayer game. Think of your ICP as a node in a network. You want your product sharable by design. Keep friction low, and make your output highly sharable.

GTM Ground Rule: Be authentic.

If you are following these two ground rules, these strategies are far more likely to succeed:

1. Building in Public (GTM Strategy)
Max Greenwald, CEO of Warmly, is radically transparent. Warmly is building marketing AI agents that understand an ICP at the level of “person-level” intent signals.

Max shares his company’s journey, metrics, challenges, and wins in real-time on LinkedIn. He’s amassed over 30,000 followers – more than his company’s official account.

Authenticity is key. Twenty years ago, an airport ad was a sign that you built a trustworthy, large company in the B2B space. Today’s digitally-native buyers respond better to authentic content than traditional advertising.

Building in public is authentic. That’s the point.

It pays off in two ways.

First, it conveys trust to your users. They feel like they’re part of the process, and more likely to trust you.

Second, it’s motivating for you. When your success or failure is so visible, it’s a bit like being a public company. When things go well, it’s great. When things go badly, it’s awful.

But that visibility creates a powerful drive to deliver.
